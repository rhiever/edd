Compiling
====================

Enter the command ./build_edd

If the console gives an error about permissions, enter:

chmod 755 build_edd

then enter the above build command again.

Usage
====================

Type ./edd to run the simulation. The following parameters can be passed to aBeeDa:

* -e [LOD out file name] [genome out file name]: evolve
* -d [genome in file name]: display 
* -dd [directory of genome files]: display all genome files in a given directory
* -s [int]: set random number generator seed
* -g [int]: set generations to evolve for
* -t [int]: save best brain every [int] generations
* -v [int]: make video of best brains at the given interval
* -lv: make video of LOD of best agent brain at the end of run
* -lt [genome in file name] [out file name]: create logic table for given genome
* -df [genome in file name] [dot out file name]: create dot image file for given genome

-e, -d, -dd, or -df must be passed to edd, otherwise it will not do anything by default.

Output
====================

edd produces a variety of output files, detailed below.

LOD files
---------------------

There will be a single entry for each ancestor in the final best swarm agent's LOD.

LOD files will be in csv format with the column headers listed at the top. Column headers are in the following order:

* generation: the generation the ancestor was born
* fitness: the fitness of the ancestor prey

Markov network brain files
---------------------

Generally, we save Markov network brain files as .genome files.

These files contain integer values which encode the Markov network brain.

Logic table files
---------------------

The logic table files contain the logic table for the most-likely decision made by the Markov network brain.

They are formatted specifically for the Logic Friday logic optimization program. They should be able to be fed directly into the Logic Friday program without any modification.

DOT files
---------------------

DOT files are the picture representations of Markov network brain structure and connectivity. We recommend using the Graphviz software to view these images.
